# Show Up Front-End

This repo contains the Node.js Express app front-end corresponding to the Rails-Api [back-end](https://github.com/uelski/show_up_backend), making up my final General Assembly project.

The idea behind this app came from aggregating information on smaller, local and DIY shows, allowing bands to act as users, sign-up, and post upcoming events. I love playing music, and found a need for often overlooked and unheard of bands to get their info out in the open in one place.

I utilized Backbone.js to bind to the API and render views styled with [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/).

Technologies used:
- Node.js & NPM
2. Express.js
3. Backbone.js
2. Materialize
3. Less
5. JSON Web Tokens for authentication
6. JQuery & JQuery UI
4. Heroku deployment
